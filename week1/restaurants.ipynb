    "# Restaurant Recommendations: Planning the Program\n",

    "At this point, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand the problem, and  \n",
    "* be familiar with the data structures we'll use to represent the data from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll design the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Review:\n",
    "\n",
    "We've created 3 dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. restaurant to rating (`dict of {str: int}`)  \n",
    "2. price range to restaurants (`dict of {str: list of str}`)  \n",
    "3. cuisine type to restaurants (`dict of {str: list of str}`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planning the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As with many programs, the first step is reading the file and building the data structures (in this case, building the three dictionaries).  \n",
    "2. Now we need to make a design decision: should we look up restaurants by price or by cuisine first? We choose to look up price first. (Choosing to look up restaurants by cuisine first would result in a different solution.) We'll make a list of the restaurants in the desired price range.  \n",
    "3. Next, we need to create a list of restaurants in the desired price range list that serve one of the desired cuisines.  \n",
    "4. Now that we have a list of restaurants in the desired price range that serve the desired cuisine type, we need to sort the restaurants based on their ratings and return the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before programming, plan your program by breaking it down into subproblems. Take notes.  \n",
    "* Work through at least one example by hand and decide how to represent the data.  \n",
    "* Decompose the problem into subproblems so that you have more places in the program to test for correctness.\n",

    "## More Planning and Some Implementation\n",
